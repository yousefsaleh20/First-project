    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    

    <p>Hello, welcome to my first site. I'll show you my two son. Little devils sent to ruin my furniture. 
        Draco and Bond my ktittens. 
        Yes kittins not children. They're only devils in their twos. Draco
        is the big boy of the two. The original goof ball. 
        He loves to lick me till Ipet him and will not stop till you do. He uses my chest as his bed everynight. 
        Bond is the quite crazy one. 
        He loves belly rubs and only will come to you for one. Other then that he minds his own business. 
        Both great and wild at 6 months old. </p>
